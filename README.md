Hey, **I'm Olivier**.

I’m an indie hacker, software engineer and artist. Currently working on products making building agreements less worrisome, supply chains more transparent, and making communities more sharing.

I've been in various technical roles for almost a decade where I have worked in a variety of projects, within enablement functions, back-end, infra and web/mobile apps roles.

🌱 Start-ups

I have helped build start-ups with some amazing people:

- Facilitating access to the circular economy at sharebee [🌍](https://sharebee.co.uk).
- Helping large brands detect, explain and act on their ESG risks in their supply chains with bendi [🌍](https://bendi.ai).[🐦](https://twitter.com/bendi_ai)
