Hey, **I'm Olivier**.

I’m an indie hacker, get-it-doner, software engineer and artist. Currently working on products making building agreements less worrisome, supply chains more transparent, and making communities more sharing.

I've been in various technical roles for a decade, where I have worked in a variety of projects, within enablement functions, back-end, infra and web/mobile apps roles.

🌱 Start-ups

I have helped build start-ups with some amazing people:

- Helping large brands detect, explain and act on their ESG risks in their supply chains with bendi [🌍](https://bendi.ai).[🐦](https://twitter.com/bendi_ai)
- Helping athletes take better control of their careers [🌍](https://wevolv.ai).
